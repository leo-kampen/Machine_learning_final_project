This project is a job recommendation model that uses BERT as a classification tool. To use our model do the following:

Upload the ML_final_job_reccomendation_model-3.ipynb file
Go down to where it says “Code below is to run the model”
Run code to import packages
Copy the path of the .csv file in the ds variable for the label encoder
Copy the file to the final model folder in the model variable and the tokenizer variable.
Run the “prepare the model” code
Now you can input a resume in the sent variable and run the “Run the model” code to get an output
